# Chess-AI
Fun with Chess and ANNs


TODO Finish README (later)


To build the project (at least, in its current state), you need CMake.

See logs.txt for a push-to-push change/update log, my thoughts on the project, and the issues I encountered/how I fixed them.


NOTE:
This code compiles correctly with both clang and gcc (as far as I can tell/tested). In order to get/compile/run the program for yourself, you need a few external libraries/header files: [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/), [GLEW](http://glew.sourceforge.net/), [GSL](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/), [stb](https://github.com/nothings/stb)
